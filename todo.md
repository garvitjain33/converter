#Currency Converter Project Todo List

###Possible Improvements

1. **Better UI/UX design:** The app could benefit from a more polished and user-friendly interface, with more attention paid to color schemes, typography, and layout.

2. **Error handling:** The app currently does not have robust error handling capabilities. Adding more error messages and handling invalid inputs would improve user experience.

3. **Testing:** Unit and integration tests should be written to ensure the app's functionality is working as intended.

4. **Mobile responsiveness:** The app could be made more mobile-friendly with responsive design and optimized for smaller screens.

5. **Refactoring:** The code could be further optimized and refactored for better performance and maintainability.

### Shortcuts Taken to Meet Deadline

1. **Limited testing:** Due to time constraints, only basic manual testing was performed, with no unit or integration tests written.

2. **Simpler UI:** The user interface was kept relatively simple and functional, with less emphasis on design and visual appeal.

3. **Minimal error handling:** Basic error messages were included, but more advanced error handling was not implemented due to time constraints.

4. **Limited optimization:** The code was optimized for speed and performance to the extent possible, but some optimization techniques may have been overlooked.

5. **Limited documentation:** Documentation was kept to a minimum, with only the most essential comments and explanations included.
