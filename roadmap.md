# Currency Converter Project Roadmap

### Backlog #1

1. **Ability to select multiple currencies:**
   Allow users to select multiple currencies to convert at once, instead of just one currency to another.

2. **Currency conversion history:** Add a feature to display a history of previously converted currencies, with the date and time of conversion.

3. **Integration with live currency exchange rates API:** Incorporate an API that provides live currency exchange rates for accurate and up-to-date conversions.

4. **User account creation and management:** Allow users to create and manage their own accounts, with the ability to save their preferred currencies and conversion history.

5. **Localization and internationalization:** Support for multiple languages and currencies, making the app more accessible to users from around the world.
